  "readme": "is-electron-renderer\n====================\n\nCheck if code is running in Electron `renderer` process.\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nElectron code can run in either the `main` process or\nthe `renderer` process. This is the same as asking if\nthe code is running in a web page with access to the\nDOM or not. Read more here: https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md\n\n### Use Cases:\n\n- Creating a single module that acts differently whether it's running in `main` or `renderer`.\n- Logging utility. One process (`main`) would be responsible for writing to log files, while\nrenderers would send log data to the `main`. Would allow your code to have one `log` method.\n- Testing. Your test code may behave differently if the DOM is available.\n- Normalize `console.log` behavior. `console.log` behavior is weird in `renderer`, this can easily be fixed.\n\n### Why Use a One Line Module?\n\nExcellent discussion here: https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/10. If that doesn't convince you,\nthen maybe the fact that Electron could change the way that they inherit `global` in `renderer` and\nif they do, you would have to change your code whereas if you used this module, you'd just have to update\nto the latest version =)\n\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n    npm i --save is-electron-renderer\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nYou'll notice that when using `console.log` in Electron that in the `renderer` process\noutputs some weird log level garbage to `stderr` before your actual console message.\nYou can normalize this behavior:\n\n**console-hook.js**:\n\n```js\n// clean up Electron output\nfunction hook () {\n  var isRenderer = require('is-electron-renderer')\n  var pre = '(' + (isRenderer ? 'RENDERER' : 'MAIN') + ') '\n  console.log = function (msg) {\n    process.stdout.write(pre + msg + '\\n')\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  hook: hook\n}\n```\n\n**index.js**:\n\n```js\nrequire('./console-hook').hook()\nconsole.log('hello')\n```\n\noutput (main):\n\n    (MAIN) hello\n\noutput (renderer):\n\n    (RENDERER) hello\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n```js\nvar isRenderer = require('is-electron-renderer')\nconsole.log(isRenderer)\n// => (BOOLEAN)\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMIT\n\nCopyright 2015 [JP Richardson](https://github.com/jprichardson)\n\n",
